# Fa25 Firmware Lab: Button + Potentiometer LED Control

Welcome to your first firmware project! üéâ  
In this lab, you‚Äôll learn how to connect simple input devices (a **button** and a **potentiometer**) to an **ESP32** and use code to control an **LED**.  
This project introduces **GPIO basics**, **analog inputs**, and **PWM duty cycle control**, which are essential skills for future work on the solar car.

## üßæ Deliverables
- LED toggles on/off with button press (includes software debouncing).  
- LED brightness responds smoothly to potentiometer when active.  
- Serial Monitor prints `"LED ON/OFF"` messages.  
- Screenshot or video demo of working circuit in **Wokwi**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup

1. Go to [https://wokwi.com/](https://wokwi.com/) ‚Üí Select **ESP32** ‚Üí Scroll down for **Starter Templates** ‚Üí Select **ESP32** (the very first one).
3. When you open a new project, you‚Äôll see something like this:
![ESP32 Template Circuit](images/ESP%20Template.png)
   - For now, ignore the left half (code editor).  
   - Let‚Äôs first make our circuit on the right half.  

### Toolbar Overview
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Run** ‚Äì compiles and runs your code.  
- üß© **Add Part** ‚Äì adds circuit components.  
- üß± **Workspace Tools** ‚Äì affects only layout/view; safe to explore.

## üß∞ Parts for This Lab

- **ESP32 Board** ‚Äì our ‚Äúmini-computer.‚Äù It runs your code and controls the rest of the circuit.  
- **LED (Light Emitting Diode)** ‚Äì output device that lights up, dims, or turns off depending on the firmware.  
- **Resistor** ‚Äì protects the LED from excess current (use 220‚Äì330 Œ©).  
- **Push Button** ‚Äì input device; pressing it sends a signal to toggle the LED.  
- **Potentiometer (variable resistor)** ‚Äì input device; turning the knob adjusts the LED‚Äôs brightness.  
- **Wires** ‚Äì connect all the components to allow current and signals to flow.

Once all parts are placed on the canvas, we‚Äôll move on to wiring them together.  

*(Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll go step by step!)*

## üîó Connecting the Circuit

### LED + Resistor
- Long leg (anode) ‚Üí through **220 Œ© resistor** ‚Üí **GPIO 15** on ESP32.  
- Short leg (cathode) ‚Üí **GND**.  

> **Why:** GPIO 15 is a general-purpose digital output. The resistor ensures the LED doesn‚Äôt burn out.

---
### Push Button
- One side ‚Üí **GPIO 4**.  
- Other side ‚Üí **GND**.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Connect the **diagonal pins**; otherwise you‚Äôre shorting the button!  
> **Why:** GPIO 4 reads **LOW** when pressed (connected to GND) and **HIGH** when released, thanks to the internal pull-up.

---
### Potentiometer
- Middle pin ‚Üí **GPIO 34** (analog input).  
- One outer pin ‚Üí **3.3 V**.  
- Other outer pin ‚Üí **GND**.  

> **Why:** GPIO 34 is an ADC pin that reads a range of values (0‚Äì4095) representing the potentiometer‚Äôs position.

---

### Power & Ground
Make sure **all components share the same 3.3 V and GND** connections.  

> Without a common reference, current won‚Äôt flow and the ESP32 can‚Äôt control or sense components.

When finished, your circuit should look similar to this (feel free to make it look neater!):

# Actual Firmware Stuff :)

Okay, the circuit‚Äôs all hooked up ‚Äî now let‚Äôs sprinkle some code magic on it!

---

On the left half of your screen, you should see two important functions:

1. setup()

   - Runs once at the very beginning.
   - Think of it like *‚Äúinitialization.‚Äù*  
     This is where you configure pins, start communication, or print a startup message.
   - Example here:  
     Serial.begin(115200) -> sets up the USB serial connection so the ESP32 can talk to your computer.

2. loop()

   - Runs over and over forever.
   - This is where your main program logic lives.  
     If you want the ESP32 to blink an LED, read a button, or check a sensor, that code will go here.

---

In this starter code, the only thing inside loop() is a short delay(10);. That doesn‚Äôt do much, but it prevents the simulation from running unnecessarily fast.


In this lab, our firmware has **two main jobs**:

1. **Read the button (pin 4)** ‚Üí Every time you press it, it should toggle the LED between ‚Äúactive‚Äù (responding to the potentiometer) and ‚Äúoff.‚Äù  
   Basically, the button acts like an on/off switch for PWM control.

2. **Read the potentiometer (pin 34)** ‚Üí The potentiometer gives us an analog value (0‚Äì4095).  
   We‚Äôll map that value into a brightness level (0‚Äì255).  
   Turning the knob = changing how bright the LED shines.

3. **Control the LED (pin 15)** ‚Üí The LED should only light up if the button has enabled it,  
   and its brightness should scale smoothly based on the potentiometer value.

---

### Big Picture Functionality

- Press the button once ‚Üí LED listens to the potentiometer.  
- Press again ‚Üí LED ignores the potentiometer and stays off.  
- Twist the knob ‚Üí LED brightness goes up and down like a dimmer.

# Time to Code!

Now that we know *what* the firmware should do, let‚Äôs start building it piece by piece.  
Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll go step-by-step ‚Äî but you‚Äôll also get chances to figure things out yourself.

---

### 1. Setup the pins

- Define which pins we‚Äôll use (LED on 15, Button on 4, Potentiometer on 34).  
  1. Think of what additional variables you may need for the LED and button, specifically debouncing.
- In setup(), tell the ESP32 whether each pin is an input or output.  
  **Hint:** The LED should be OUTPUT, the button should be INPUT_PULLUP.  
  Can you guess why?


### 2. Read the button (with debouncing)

- Try writing code to check if the button is pressed.
- What logic level (HIGH or LOW) will you see when it‚Äôs pressed?
- Recap on debouncing: sometimes one press = multiple signals (because of mechanical *bouncing*).

Add a simple **debounce** using millis():

- Remember the last time the button was pressed.
- Only accept a new press if enough time (e.g., 150 ms) has passed.
- millis(): this is a built-in Arduino function that returns the number of milliseconds that have passed since your ESP32 started running the current program.

**Bonus:** Add a toggle (pressed once = ON, pressed again = OFF).


### 3. Read the potentiometer and map the value

- Use analogRead(POT_PIN) to see what values you get when turning the knob.  
  Print these values to Serial Monitor.  
  What‚Äôs the range? *(Spoiler: ~0‚Äì4095).*
- We want to turn those big numbers into something useful for LED brightness.  
  Use the map() function to scale 0‚Äì4095 ‚Üí 0‚Äì255.
hint: map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)

### 4. Drive the LED

- Finally, send the mapped value to the LED.  
  UseÔºö analogWrite(LED_PIN, duty);
- If the button has turned the LED ‚Äúoff,‚Äù then don‚Äôt write anything except 0.

### üß† Sanity Check (Before Getting Checked Off)

Here is what is supposed to happen when you run the code:

1. The **LED will initially be OFF**, waiting for a button press.

2. Press the **button once** to turn the LED **ON** ‚Äî now the LED will respond to the **potentiometer**.  
   - **Twist the potentiometer** to change the LED‚Äôs brightness smoothly.

3. Press the **button again** to turn the LED **OFF**, no matter the potentiometer position.

4. The **Serial Monitor** will show:
   - "LED ON" when the button enables the LED.
   - "LED OFF" when the button disables the LED.

### üí° Pro-tip

If the LED doesn‚Äôt change brightness or the button doesn‚Äôt work, check your wiring carefully ‚Äî especially the button‚Äôs connection to **GND**.

**IMPORTANT: Upon finishing the project, please reach out to lab staff for check off.
