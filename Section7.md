# Section 7: Introduction to Firmware Lab

Welcome to the CalSol Electrical subteam for real this time!

WIP of what the final lab project actually is

### Here is a general overview of the hardware training:
- [Section 8](./Section8.md) introduce the software we will be using for firmware (VSCode, Platform.io, Git)
- [Section 9](./Section9.md) is an overview of basic coding in C. If you have experience and/or took CS61C, you can skim over this section
- [Section 10](./Section10.md) introduces the basics of firmware
- [Section 11](./Section11.md) explains the LED dimmer Project

## Deadline for returning AND new members (Sunday, October 12th at midnight)
This is a hard deadline as we don't want to be working on labs when projects start up

# OFFICE HOUR TIMES
There will be no in person OH, but please come with questions on Wednesday. Also feel free to DM me or Eric. In general, we will start threads in Electrical, so please help out fellow members and get help from fellow members.
