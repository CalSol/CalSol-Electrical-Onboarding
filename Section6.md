# Section 6: Bring Up
Congratulations! You have finished designing your PCB! We do not expect you to buy your own board; instead, our lovely CalSol team has already designed and ordered naked PCBs. 

What does bring-up mean?
Bring up means to assemble, test, program, and debug to make sure the design is satisfactory and meets all requirements.

Now please follow the following [link](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad-8) on making Gerber files and drill files (files that tell the manufacturer the design and layout of your board). We are using JCLPCB.

Now, go upload your design onto [JCLPCBâ€™s website](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote?edaOrderUrl=https%3A%2F%2Feasyeda.com%2Forder&electropolishingOnlyNo=no&achieveDate=72) to see if you have passed all their manufacturer constraints. 

## Your next step is to show up to any office hour timeslot (see image below) and bring up a pre-designed board. 

In this last section, you will be assembling a PCB of the same circuit. So you will learn how to solder, use the power supply, and use an oscilloscope to verify your PWM signal. 

### Show up to office hours to complete the bring-up process. THIS IS REQUIRED to pass the lab.
### You will need to pass the layout check off beforehand.

### Good luck!
