# Fa25 Firmware Lab: Button + Potentiometer LED Control

Welcome to your first firmware project! ðŸŽ‰  
In this lab, youâ€™ll learn how to connect simple input devices (a **button** and a **potentiometer**) to an **ESP32** and use code to control an **LED**.  
This project introduces **GPIO basics**, **analog inputs**, and **PWM duty cycle control**, which are essential skills for future work on the solar car.
