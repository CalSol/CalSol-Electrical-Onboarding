# Section 7: Introduction to Firmware Lab

Welcome to the CalSol Electrical subteam for real this time!

WIP of what the final lab project actually is

### Here is a general overview of the hardware training:
- [Section 8](./Section8.md) introduce the software we will be using for firmware (VSCode, Platform.io, Git)
- [Section 9](./Section9.md) is an overview of basic coding in C. If you have experience and/or took CS61C, you can skim over this section
- [Section 10](./Section10.md) introduces the basics of firmware
- [Section 11](./Section11.md) goes over key concepts specific to our car including communication protocols
- [Section 12](./Section12.md) WIP explains the project

## Deadline for returning AND new members (Sunday, October 12th at midnight)
This is a hard deadline as we don't want to be working on labs when projects start up
