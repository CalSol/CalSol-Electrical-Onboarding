# Section 6: Bring Up
Congratulations! You have finished designing your PCB! We do not expect you to buy your own board; instead, our lovely CalSol team has already designed and ordered naked PCBs. 

What does bring-up mean?
Bring up means to assemble, test, program, and debug to make sure the design is satisfactory and meets all requirements.

Now please follow the following [link](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad-8) on making Gerber files and drill files (files that tell the manufacturer the design and layout of your board). We are using JCLPCB.

Now, go upload your design onto [JCLPCBâ€™s website](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote?edaOrderUrl=https%3A%2F%2Feasyeda.com%2Forder&electropolishingOnlyNo=no&achieveDate=72) to see if you have passed all their manufacturer constraints. 

## Your next step is to show up to a soldering event!

In this last section, you will be assembling a PCB and verifying the circuit you designed. So you will learn how to solder, use the power supply, and use an oscilloscope to verify your PWM signal. We will demonstrate the actual board itself working on 9/29 after the Electrical Meeting

### Show up to one of the events below to complete the bring-up process. THIS IS REQUIRED to pass the lab.

1) IEEE GM + Soldering Workshop (9/26 5-7PM in the Soda Wozniak Lounge)
2) After EM Monday Soldering (9/29 9-10PM in Supernode).

Note: we do not have the bandwidth to accomodate more than 5 people for the second option. We heavily encourage going to the IEEE workshop (there is pizza as well), but if you can't make it then message us ahead of time so we can prepare our soldering workshop. Also, our soldering workshop is able to be attended by everyone, but only 8 people will be able to solder and get checked off.

### Good luck!
